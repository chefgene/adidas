## Dataset Overview
I was provided with one dataset for this analysis. The dataset includes:

name of countries, sex. age, number of suicide, GDP per capita, number of suicide/100k, population, and generation.

## Data Preparation
I imported the datasets into Power BI Power Query for the transformation and validation of the data.

## Data Cleaning
* Changed data types of columns with incorrect data types.
* Removed unnecessary columns for easy analysis.
^ Created another column for MMM-YYY to analyze the trends

## What is the state with the highest profit and with the highest sales?
the state with the top sales was New York with sales of $64.2M followed by California and Florida this same trend was 
 also observed with the profit, New York also tops the list with a profit of $23.3M followed by California and Florida. and this can be due to two reasons; the population of these states and the standard of living of those living in these states. Even though Florida came third in terms of sales but came second among the states with the highest profit with a total profit of $20.9M

  ## what do you think is the factor responsible for the high sales in those states and regions we have the highest profit and sales?
   it's worthy of note to see that there has been a constant increase both in the sales and profit from 2020 to 2021, we have low sales in June and December in 2020 Q1 and Q4  and this is due to the effect of COVID-19 the same trend was also observed in the profit trend. 

   the state with the highest number of sales by the unit was seen as New York with a sales unit of 0.169M followed by California.

## What is the prediction of our sales and profit in the next two quarters of 2022
6. the prediction analysis with the trends we have shows that definitely with all things being equal with the way the trends have been going up, we will have a constant increase in sales and profits.


  ## Recommendation

1. Adidas should continue to maintain relationships with the top retailers to maintain commitment and loyalty by offering incentives.


incentives
2 the largest sales from an ONLINE as one of the sales methods with over 50% and  this should actually be encouraged the more beyond that we can still increase the sales of using in-store as other sales method by partnering with closer stores to the residentials
